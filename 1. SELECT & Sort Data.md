# SELECT

```sql
SELECT
	column_name_1,
	column_name_2
FROM schema_name.table_name
```

- **Select Specific Columns**

  - *Show only `language_id` and `name` columns from the `language` table*

    ```sql
    SELECT
    	language_id, name
    FROM 
    	dvd_rentals.language;
    ```

- **Limit Output Rows**

  - `LIMIT` to restrict the output to just the first few rows from the query

    - *Show the first 10 rows from the `actor` tables*

      ```sql
      SELECT *
      FROM dvd_rentals.actor
      LIMIT 10;
      ```

- **Sorting Query Results**

  - Use `ORDER BY` clause at the end of our queries to sort the output
  - By default, the sorting will be done in **ascending order** and we can perform multi-level sorting by specifying more than one column
  - One more thing about `NULL` values also - by default PostrgreSQL will put all null values last unless specified with a `NULLS FIRST` 

- **Sort By Text Column**

  - *What are the first 5 values in the `country` column from the `country` table by alphabetical order?*

    - ```sql
      SELECT country
      FROM dvd_rentals.country
      ORDER BY country
      LIMIT 5;
      ```

- **Sort By Numeric/Date Column**

  - Sorting for any column with numbers, dates, timestamps is done from lowest to highest or latest to earliest for date time related columns.

    - *What are the 5 lowest `total_sales` values in the `sales_by_film_category` table?*

      ```sql
      SELECT total_sales
      FROM dvd_rentals.sales_by_film_category
      ORDER BY 1
      LIMIT 5;
      ```

- **Sort by Descending**

  - We can also use the keyword `DESC` after the `ORDER BY` to reverse the sort order

  - This is useful for text fields but is most common when trying to find the largest numeric value of a column or the latest date of a specific date time column

    - *What are the first 5 values in **reverse** alphabetical order in the `country` column from the `country` table?*

      ```sql
      SELECT country
      FROM dvd_rentals.country
      ORDER BY country DESC
      LIMIT 5; 
      ```

      

    - *Which `category` had the lowest `total_sales` value according to the `sales_by_film_category` table? What was the `total_sales` value?*

      ```sql
      SELECT category, total_sales
      FROM dvd_rentals.sales_by_film_category
      ORDER BY total_sales
      LIMIT 1;
      ```

    - *What was the latest `payment_date` of all dvd rentals in the `payment` table*

      ```sql
      SELECT payment_date
      FROM dvd_rentals.payment
      ORDER BY payment_date DESC
      LIMIT 1;
      ```

- **Sort By Multiple Columns**

  - we can also perform a multi-level sort by specifying 2 or more columns with the `ORDER BY` clause

  - **Both Ascending**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sample_table
    ORDER BY column_a, column_b
    ```

  - **Ascending & Descending**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sample_table
    ORDER BY column_a DESC, column_b
    ```

  - **Both Descending**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sample_table
    ORDER BY column_a DESC, column_b DESC
    ```

  - **Different Column Order**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sample_table
    ORDER BY column_b DESC, column_a
    ```

    **NOTE: This is a very import concept. **

- **Example Sorting Questions**

  - *Which customer_id had the latest rental_date for inventory_id = 1 and 2*

    ```sql
    SELECT 
    	customer_id,
    	inventory_id,
    	rental_date
    FROM dvd_rentals.rental
    ORDER BY inventory_id, rental_date DESC
    LIMIT 8;
    ```

  - *In the `dvd_rentals.sales_by_film_category` table, which category has the highest total_sales*

    ```sql
    SELECT category, total_sales
    FROM dvd_rentals.sales_by_film_category
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

## Exerices 

- *what is the name of the category with the highest category_id in the dvd_rentals.category table*

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  category_id
FROM
  dvd_rentals.category
ORDER BY
  category_id DESC
```

- *for the films with the longest length, what is the title of the "R" rated film with the lowest replacement_cost in dvd_rentals*

  ```sql
  SELECT title,  replacement_cost,length, rating
  FROM dvd_rentals.film
  ORDER BY length DESC, replacement_cost
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- *3. who was the manager of the store with the highest total_sales in the dvd_rentals.sales_by_store table*

  ```sql
  SELECT manager, total_sales
  FROM dvd_rentals.sales_by_store
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
  ```

- *4.What is the postal code of the city with the 5th highest city_id in the dvd_rentals.address table*

  ```sql
  SELECT postal_code, city_id
  FROM dvd_rentals.address
  ORDER BY city_id DESC
  LIMIT 5; 
  ```

# Appendix

## Aplitting Statements With `;`

This `;` is known as a 'statement terminator' and is used to tell the SQL engine that is is the end of a SQL statement. 

## Limit Usage

In some SQL flavours like SQL Server and Teradata, `TOP` is used instead of `LIMIT` and goes in the front of the `SELECT` statement

```sql
SELECT TOP 10*
FROM some_schema.table_name;
```

## Order by Additional Notes

if there is null value in the row. we can specific with addition condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM test_data
ORDER BY 1 NULLS FIRST;
-- order by 1 desc NULLS first 
```
