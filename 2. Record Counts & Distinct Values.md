# Record Counts & Distinct Values

## 2.How many Records

- It is really important to know **how many rows in a dataset**

  - *how many rows are there in the `film_list`*

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
    FROM dvd_rentals.film_list;
    ```



### 2.1 Column Aliases

- `AS row_count` after that `COUNT(*)` known as a 'Column alias'
- `COUNT(1)` and `COUNT(*)` is the **same**

## 3.DISTINCT For Unique Values

### 3.1 Show Unique Column Values

- `Distinct` keyword to obtain unique values from a deduplicated target column 

  - *What are the unique values fro the `rating` column in thr film table?*

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT rating
    FROM dvd_rental.film_list
    ```

### 3.2 Count of Unique Values

- we can use the `COUNT` function with the `DISTINCT` keyword to find the number of unique values of a specific column. 

  - *How many unique `category` values are there in the `film_list` table?*

     ```sql
     SELECT 
     COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS 			  unique_category_count
     FROM dvd_rentals.film_list
     ```

## 4.Group By Count

- we can using the `GROUP BY` clause with a `COUNT` aggregate function to help us generate a basic frequency value counts output

- One way to think of the `GROUP BY` is to imagine our dataset being divided into different groups based off the values of selected columns

  - *What is the frequency of values in the `rating` column in the `film_list` table*

    ```sql
    -- Simplified table example
    SELECT fid, title, category, rating, price
    FROM dvd_rentals.film_list
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

### 4.4 Single Column Value Counts

- The `GROUP BY ` must be used after the `FROM ` statement otherwise you will get a syntax error

  - *What is the frequency of values in the rating column in the film table?*

    ```sql
    SELECT rating, COUNT(*) as frequency
    FROM dvd_rentals.film_list
    GROUP BY rating;
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT rating, COUNT(*) as frequency
    FROM dvd_rantals.film_list
    GROUP BY rating
    ORDER BY frequency;
    ```

    NOTE: **`order by` clause must occur after the `GROUP BY`**

### 4.5 Adding a Percentage Column

- sometimes the frequency is just not enough to really understand the frequency at a quick glance, so we like to create an additional percentage column to our dataset. 

- the most efficient way using a modified windown function combining both `SUM` and `COUNT` functions with an `OVER()`

- `::NUMERIC` right after the `COUNT(*)` - this is to avoid the dreaded integer floor division

  ```sql
  SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS frequency, 
                 COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS percentage
                 
   FROM dvd_rentals.film_list
   GROUP BY rating
   ORDER BY frequency DESC;
  ```

- We can also multiple this percentage value by 100 and round it to 1 decimal place using a ROUND function. 

## 5. Counts For Multiple Column Combinations

- We can use `GROUP BY` on 2+ columns at the bottom of the SQL statement. 

  - *What are the 5 most frequent `rating` and `category` combinations in the `film_list` table?*

    ```sql
    SELECt rating, category, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM dvd_rentals.film_list
    GROUP BY rating, category
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
    LIMIT 5; 
    ```

### 5.2 Using Positional Numbers Instead of Column Names

- This is usually just a stylistic choice 

  ```sql
  SELECT rating, category, COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM dvd_rentals.film_list
  GROUP BY 1, 2
  ```



# Exerices

1. *which `actor_id` has the most number of unique `film_id` records in the `dvd_rantals.film_actor` table?*

   ```sql
   SELECT actor_id, COUNT (DISTINCT film_id) AS unique_film_id
   FROM dvd.rentals.film_actor
   GROUP BY actor_id
   ORDER BY unqiue_film_id DESC;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT price, COUNT(DISTINCT fid)
   FROM dvd_rentals.nice_but_slower_film_list
   GROUP BY price
   ORDER BY 2 DESC; 
   ```

3. *How many unique`country_id` values exist in the `dvd_rentals.city` table?*
