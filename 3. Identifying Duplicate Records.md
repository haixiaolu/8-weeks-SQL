# Identifying Duplicate Data

## 1. Record Counts

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM health.user_logs
```

## 2. Unique Column Counts

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM health.user_logs
```

## 3.Single Column Frequency Counts

- most frequent values within `measure` column using `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT 
	measure, COUNT(*) AS frequency,
	ROUND(100 * COUNT(*)/ SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) AS percentage
	
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY measure
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

- Check the `id` column too

  ```sql
  SELECT 
  	id,
  	COUNT(*) AS frequency
  	ROUND(
    	100* COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(),
    	2
    	) AS percentage
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY id
  ORDER BY frequency DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

## 4. Individual Column Distributions

### 4.1 Measure Column

```sql
SELECT 
	measure_value,
	COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10; 
	
```

### 4.2 Systolic

```sql	
SELECT
	systolic,
	COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10; 
```

## 5. How to Deal with Duplicates

- A few ways to deal with duplicate records
  - Remove them in a `SELECT` statement
  - Recreating a 'clean' version of our dataset
  - Identify exactly which rows are duplicated for further investigation 
  - Simply ignore the duplicates and leave the dataset alone

### 5.1 Detecting Duplicate Records

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM health.user_logs;
```

### 5.2 Remove All Duplicates

- apply `DISTINCT` keyword

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT *
  FROM health.user_logs;
  ```

#### 5.2.1 Subqueries

- A subquery is essentially a query within a query

- Subquery must always have an alias

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM(
  	SELECT DISTINCT *
  	FROM health.user_logs
  ) AS subqurey;
  ```

#### 5.2.2 Common Table Expression (CTE)

- CTE stands for `Common Table Expression`- and when we compare it to something simple like Excel, we can think of CTEs as transformations applied to raw data inside an existing Excel Sheet. 

- A CTE is a SQL query that manipulates existing data and stores the data outputs as new reference. 

- **CTE Example Query**

  ```sql
  WITH deduped_logs AS (
  	SELECT DISTINCT *
  	FROM health.user_logs)
  	
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM deduped_logs;
  ```

#### 5.2.3 Temporary Tables

- we can also create a temporary table with only the unique values of our dataset after we run the `DISTINCT` query

- This is very common approach when you know that you will only be analyzing the ddeduplicated dataset, and you will ignore the original one with duplicates. 

- The main benefit of using temporary tables is removing the need to always run the same `DISTINCT` command everytime you want to run a query on the deduplicated records

- *first use following commond, super careful*

  `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deduplicated_user_logs;`

- *create a new temporary table*

  ```sql
  CREATE TEMP TABLE deduplicated_user_logs AS
  SELECT DISTINCT *
  FROM health.user_logs;
  ```

- *query this newly created temporary table*

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM deduplicated_user_logs
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- *run that same `COUNT` on this deduplicated temp table*

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM deduplicated_user_logs;
  ```

## 6. Identifying Duplicate Records

### 6.1. Group By Count On All Columns

- use a `GROUP BY` clause which ahs every single column in the grouping element and `COUNT` aggregate function. 

  ```sql
  SELECT
  	id, 
  	log_date,
  	measure,
  	measure_value,
  	systolic,
  	diastolic,
  	COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY id,
  				 log_date,
  				 measure,
  				 measure_value,
  				 systolic,
  				 diastolic
  ORDER BY frequency DESC;
  ```

### 6.2. Having Clause For Unique Duplicates

- Now the final step is to use the `HAVING` clause to further trim down our output by applying a condition on the same `COUNT` expression we were using for the `frequency` column we created in our previous query. 

- Since we only want the duplicated records to be returned, we would like that `COUNT(*)` value to be greater than 1. 

  ```SQL
  -- Don't forget to clean up any existing temp tables
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS unique_duplicate_records;
  
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE unique_duplicate_records AS
  SELECT *
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY
  	id,
  	log_date,
  	measure,
  	measure_value,
  	systolic,
  	diastolic
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  
  -- Finally let's inspect the top 10 rows of our temp table 
  SELECT *
  FROM unique_duplicate_records
  LIMIT 10; 
  ```

### 6.3. Retaining Duplicate Counts (ETC method)

```sql
WITH groupby_counts AS(
	SELECT
		id,
		log_date,
		measure,
		measure_value,
		systolic,
		diastolic,
		COUNT(*) AS frequency
	FROM health.user_logs
	GROUP BY 
		id,
		log_date,
		measure,
		measure_value,
		systolic,
		diastolic
  )
 SELECT *
 FROM groupby_counts
 WHERE frequency > 1
 ORDER BY frequency DESC
 LIMIT 10; 
```
